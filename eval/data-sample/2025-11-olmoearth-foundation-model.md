## Summary

OlmoEarth is a family of open foundation models designed to enhance Earth observation capabilities. These models are trained on extensive multimodal Earth observation data, enabling them to transform raw satellite signals into actionable insights across various spatial and temporal scales.

## Model Family

| Model | Parameters | Use Case |
|-------|------------|----------|
| **OlmoEarth-v1-Nano** | ~1.4M | Rapid, cost-effective large-scale inference |
| **OlmoEarth-v1-Tiny** | ~6.2M | Balancing speed and accuracy for scalable applications |
| **OlmoEarth-v1-Base** | ~90M | Balance between accuracy and computational efficiency |
| **OlmoEarth-v1-Large** | ~300M | Top-tier performance for complex, demanding tasks |

## Capabilities

The models demonstrate exceptional performance across Earth observation tasks:
- Scene and patch classification
- Semantic segmentation
- Object and change detection
- Regression analyses (single-image and time-series)

## Performance Benchmarks

OlmoEarth outperforms several existing foundation models from both industrial research labs and academic institutions:
- Meta's DINOv3
- IBM/NASA's Prithvi
- IBM's Terramind

## Real-World Applications

### Agriculture and Food Security
Accurate mapping of smallholder crop types in regions like Sub-Saharan Africa, aiding in targeted agricultural interventions.

### Fire Risk Assessment
Enhanced estimation of live fuel moisture content for more precise ignition-risk maps and better wildfire management.

### Maritime Detection
Improved detection capabilities in both optical and radar domains, supporting maritime safety and fisheries enforcement.

### Land-Cover and Ecosystem Mapping
High-performance mapping that aids in habitat protection and land-use planning.
