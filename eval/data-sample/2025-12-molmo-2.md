## Summary

Molmo 2 is a new suite of state-of-the-art vision-language models with open weights, training data, and training code that can analyze videos and multiple images at once. It extends Molmo's strengths in grounded vision to video and multi-image understanding.

## Model Variants

- **Molmo 2 (8B)**: Qwen 3-based, best overall model for video grounding and QA
- **Molmo 2 (4B)**: Qwen 3-based, optimized for efficiency
- **Molmo 2-O (7B)**: Built on Olmo, fully open end-to-end model flow including the underlying LLM

## Key Capabilities

### State-of-the-art Performance
- Leads or ties for best results among open peers on image QA, short-video QA, video counting, video tracking, and human preference
- Molmo 2 (8B) outperforms the original Molmo (72B) on key image pointing and grounding benchmarks
- On video tracking, leapfrogs Gemini 3 Pro and strong open-weight alternatives

### Video Grounding Features
- **Counting-by-pointing**: Returns points and timestamps for events
- **Multi-object tracking**: Persistent IDs that follow objects across occlusions and re-entries
- **Dense video captioning**: Highly descriptive and searchable narratives of long clips
- **Anomaly detection**: Flags rare or surprising events
- **Artifact detection**: Points to flaws in generative video
- **Subtitle-aware QA**: Combines visual evidence with in-video subtitles

## Architecture

The architecture consists of:
- Vision encoder that processes images or video frames into visual tokens
- Language model backbone (Qwen 3 or Olmo)
- Lightweight connector that interleaves visual tokens with timestamps, image indices, and text

### Training
- Two-stage training process: pretraining for alignment/grounding, then SFT on multimodal mixture
- Samples up to 128 frames at ≤2 fps per clip
- Trained on less than one-eighth of the video data used by Meta's PerceptionLM (9.19M vs 72.5M videos)
